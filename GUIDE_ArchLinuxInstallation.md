# Arch Linux Installation Guide

> Nuno Penim, 2020

## Preface

Congratulations, if you are reading this, you found a very special document I wrote not only to help myself, but to help other like minded individuals.

After this, you should have a full working Arch Linux installation, running the Gnome DE and with the GDM. If this is not what you are here for, Google how to do your specific Setup. I will not answer any pull requests.

This was done specifically in a 2012 Toshiba Portégé Z930, with an Intel Core i7-3667U, 12GiB of RAM and 256GB of SSD. It should work on any other machine though. *I did not use UEFI!*

Every problem you run into can be solved either by looking in the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), or by searching in the [Forum](https://bbs.archlinux.org/). Currently, everything in my machine works fine (even the Fingerprint Sensor, SD Card Reader and Bluetooth). External peripherals, such as my Wi-Fi printer work as well!

## Installation instructions and Steps

### Step 0: Backup your data

Or prepare it to be migrated. We will format your HDD/SDD entirely, so... yeah

### Step 1: Download the Arch Linux ISO file

The title pretty much explains it. To do it, access [https://archlinux.org/download/](https://archlinux.org/download/) and download the most recent ISO file. I recommend using BitTorrent, but it's up to you.

### Step 2: Make a bootable flash drive.

I recommend using [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) for this step. Download the suitable version for you (Windows, macOS or Linux). The Linux version is usually an AppImage file, which runs (or should run) on all distros. If you are geeky, you could use dd on Linux, works too.

Always keep this flash drive around after, maybe label it. It will be important as it might be the only way you can solve any possible boot issues in the future.

### Step 3: Configure your machine
