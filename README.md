### About me:
  - Enthusiast user of [Arch Linux](https://github.com/nunopenim/nunopenim/blob/main/GUIDE_ArchLinuxInstallation.md), learning every day. This is one of the reasons why most of my Linux oriented projects are starting to include instructions specific to Arch Linux.
  - Experienced user of Debian and Debian based distros. Big love to Ubuntu and Xubuntu!
  - Comfortable with Apple's macOS (Specially the terminal, feels like home as it is a UNIX compliant OS). Using XCode too!
  - Not a user of RHEL, Slackware, Gentoo, SUSE or BSD (and based distros) but I might be able to learn quickly.
  - Okay with Windows, but not too comfortable (only fully used Windows 7 until about 2016, newer versions, and PowerShell synthax are a bit confusing to me).
  - Learning Swift in the little free time I have (I'm actually enjoying it a lot).
  - Comfortable with C, C++, Assembly (MIPS and x86, however I might learn others relatively quickly), Java, Python, a *little* of Objective-C, Kotlin and Dart (applied to mobile development and the Flutter framework).
  - Not too good with Web stuff, but can get around basic CSS and basic HTML when needed (Javascript and Typescript are okay, but not a preference).
