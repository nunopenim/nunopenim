### About me:
  - Enthusiast user of [Arch Linux](https://github.com/nunopenim/nunopenim/blob/main/GUIDE_ArchLinuxInstallation.md) (my new favourite distro and daily driver, learning every day).
  - Experienced user of Debian and Debian based distros.
  - Not a user of RHEL, Slackware, Gentoo or SUSE (and based distros) but I might be able to learn quickly.
  - Comfortable with the macOS Terminal. A little lost in the GUI, but getting used to it. Starting to use XCode too!
  - Not too comfortable with Windows, Powershell is a bit of an unknown ground to me, will take time to get used.
  - Learning Swift and Dart.
  - Relearning Kotlin.
  - Comfortable with C, C++, Assembly (MIPS and x86, however I might learn others relatively quickly), Java and Python.
  - Not too good with Web stuff, but can get around CSS and HTML when needed.
