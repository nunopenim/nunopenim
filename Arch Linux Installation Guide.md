# Arch Linux Installation Guide
> Nuno Penim, 2020

## Preface
Congratulations, if you are reading this, you found a very special document I wrote not only to help myself, but to help other like minded individuals.

After this, you should have a full working Arch Linux installation, running the Gnome DE and with the GDM. If this is not what you are here for, Google how to do your specific Setup. I will not answer any pull requests.

This was done specifically in a 2012 Toshiba Portégé Z930, with an Intel Core i7-3667U, 12GiB of RAM and 256GB of SSD. It should work on any other machine though.

Every problem you run into can be solved either by looking in the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), or by searching in the [Forum](https://bbs.archlinux.org/). Currently, everything in my machine works fine (even the Fingerprint Sensor, SD Card Reader and Bluetooth). External peripherals, such as my Wi-Fi printer work as well!
